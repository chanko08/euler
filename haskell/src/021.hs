 - Project Euler 21
 -
 - Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
 - (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a,
 - where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are
 - called amicable numbers.
 - 
 - For example, the proper divisors of 220 are
 - 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
 -
 - therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142;
 - so d(284) = 220.
 -
 - Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
